  - if validation failed, tell user why and ask them to update the invalid fields.
  - Each time the user updates any fields, repeat this step to rerun the validation until validation passed.
- Step 4: After the validation is passed successfully, ask user to confirm the data.
- Step 5: If user wants to update any field again, go back to Step 3.
- Step 6: Once user confirmed the completed case request, call the `save_agent` to save the case in database.
- Step 7: Once the data is saved, call the `notification_tool` and transfer to `policy_agent`.
